                in authority,a big sister of two. She is a risk taker and one of the risks she took was doing Software Engineering
                when she had no clue what it was all about. She loves challenging stuff because the believes she can do it...<i>Philipians 4:13</i>

     <h3>Study background</h3>
    <p style="font-family:Helvetica,Aral, sans-serif;">
        I did my primary at Chinembiri primary in Chitungwiza and came out with 9 units .<br>
        <p>
        I went on to do my 'O' Level at Chemhanza High in Hwedza,this is where with the help of my parents i realised my potential.
        They pressured me to read,fortunately i complied maybe because i was in the worst class &#128524;,i ended up being the best girl there. My class mates would really look up to me
        and that pushed me to work harder. It is then that i realised that i could make it in life given i put the necessary effort.
        I managed to enter into the science class at form 3,unsurprisingly,i was the only girl from my class that got into the best class.
        I still remember,i got the motivation of my life then when i got a 100% on my first Maths test &#128516;,we were three. I also remeber this incident when i was the only girl -the whole streem- who had more than seventy percent in Maths, i was happy shem.
         this actually gave me the strength to work harder and i ended up coming out with flying colours.<br>
        </p>
       <p> I then proceded to do my A level at Seke 1 High in Chitungwiza. I worked hard enough to come out with not so  many points.
        At this stage i was kinda heartbrocken for i wanted to do Pharmacy. I applied here at HIT and i still remember, Software Engineering
        was my last prefference. I was actually scared when i got the place,my sister there told me how much being a HIT student was very hard
        and on top of it i had no history with computers. Iwas scared kani &#128550;,lucky enough,here i am...I can actually see that this was the best
         decision i ever made. It reminds me of how God knows what is best for us. I fell in love with SE&#128525; the first lecture when we were told how much we can do and how people like us are vital in todays living. The fact tha we will be solving problems
         in a technical way was the most fascinating. I imagined myself putting a smile on ones face after having made a system for him.
         one of the most motivating factors came from my lecturer - my favourite if i can say. I actually saw myself through him. He wanted to do Pharmacyas well but he was offered a place to study Computer Science instead.
         Fastforward , he has made a lot of functioning systems some for the country. It gives the vibe that I too can make it. The vibe that nothing is impossible.
