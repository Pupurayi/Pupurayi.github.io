<p>
They say everyone has a story to tell,that is indeed correct!<br>
Growing up i used to be so naughty,my mom always remind me that i was the naughtiest of all her four children. I was so much alive kani you know the energy those little ones have...
I used to be a slow learner,i remember this other teacher of mine used to call me "dofo"...It all changed this other term, grade 5 third term,i went home ndiri # 32&#128514. My parents sat
me down - i don't remember what exactly they said- and i realised i had to do something about my perfomance. I came up number 8 the next term &#128516.</br>
Nowonder people say everyone has got a history.
